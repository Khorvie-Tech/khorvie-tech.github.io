  <h3>Debloated Win 11 23h2</h3>
  <p>This is the operating system that I use for testing purposes; it has no real optimizations applied to it. It is simply debloated with a more simplified installation process.</p>

<p><u>If you would like to support me though, you can do so by spreading this website and articles to others.</u></p>

<h3>How do you make these</h3>
<p>Through a program called NTLite, it provides me access to features such as.</p>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>Add to the registry</li>
    <li>Remove Components/Bloat</li>
    <li>Turn on/off Services</li>
    <li>Run scripts on first startup</li>
    <li>Plus more!</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Why do you make these free?</h3>
<p>I think to have the most outreach, keeping it a free product is best; I've come to really enjoy automatic optimization instead of doing everything manually so I find this way to align with that the most.</p>
<p>I don't gain anything from giving this out as a free product, you are not the product and I do not collect or track anything from your usage.</p>

<p>Hey! I’m Khorvie—well, that’s what most people know me as. My real name exists somewhere, but even my family doesn’t really use it. They’ve got their own nickname for me, and online I go by Khorvie (short for Khorviare, a misspelling of Khorvaire from Dungeons & Dragons Online—because I’m a dyslexic geek like that).

<p>My journey into tech and optimizations started way before I knew what a registry tweak even was. The first game I ever played was Minecraft on the Xbox 360, usually with my little brother right beside me. That game still holds a special place in my heart. Eventually, I branched out into Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 (mainly for Nuketown and Zombies) and then Halo Reach—which is, objectively, the best Halo. Don’t argue. You can’t win.</p>

<p>These games were my rotation until Fortnite dropped. I’ve been playing nearly since the beginning on Xbox One, but it didn’t take long before I upgraded(?) to my first gaming PC. I say “upgraded” loosely—this rig had a GT 730 and a 6700K. I was a goated player despite running Fortnite at sub-60 FPS. But either way, the lag and stutter? Not it.</p>

<p>That’s when I went full rabbit hole into PC optimizations. I watched everyone I could find, but the one who really stood out after some time was AdamX. Back when he was on the rise, his videos were everything. If you know, you know. He had way more content than what’s left online now(most are deleted now), and I was glued to every upload.</p>

<p>Eventually, I got some upgrades, locked in a stable 144 FPS, and became the go-to tech fixer among my (singular) friend. That turned into making my own videos. My original YouTube channel is long gone, but my second channel, CoreVeeAir, had my first taste of success (those videos are now unlisted). Then came Khorvie Tech—and that’s when things really clicked.</p>

<p>A few personal bits: I was born in 2004. I’m into Japanese [(the language, not just anime) but I love anime too], casual vocals/singing, and I grew up loving volleyball and soccer. A lot of people assume I was a good student because I’m into computer stuff now—but nope. I was a terrible student. I have Asperger’s (autism), and I didn’t even know it until after graduating high school. I spent my entire life thinking I was just “dumb” when in reality I was navigating everything with a neurodivergent brain and no support. It made school, making friends, and life... tough. But I pushed through(or at least I'm still trying to) .</p>

<p>As of June 2025, I’m preparing to step away from the channel for two years to serve a mission for my church (LDS). After that, I’ll be back—ready to keep building the channel and then join and contribute to my family's business.</p>

<p>Thanks for checking out the site, and for getting to know the guy behind the screen. Whether you’re here to optimize your rig or just curious, I’m glad you stopped by <333 .</p>

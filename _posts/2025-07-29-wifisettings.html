<p> Note: There are a lot of caveats to what will be 'best' for you.... especially with network settings there is no true general consensus on what is best for everyone so make sure to apply settings carefully and test things for yourself</p>
<h3>20/40 Coexistence</h3>
<p>Ensures the wireless adapter switches automatically between 20 MHz and 40 MHz channel width depending on interference and coexistence with other devices, minimizing disruption.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled for compatibility with nearby networks.</p>

<h3>40 MHz Intolerant / Fat channel Intolerant</h3>
<p>Signals to other Wi-Fi devices that this adapter cannot tolerate 40 MHz channels, forcing 20 MHz operation to reduce interference.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless you experience Wi-Fi interference issues.</p>

<h3>802.11n Preamble</h3>
<p>Sets the preamble type for 802.11n transmission, impacting compatibility and performance between legacy and modern devices. Long Preamble is needed for older 802.11b/g adapters, for weaker signals (lower RSSI),  while strong signals and 802.11n/ac devices generally work well with short preamble. The short preamble will yield slightly better performance if the signal is strong and there is no packet loss, however, it needs to be set the same on all devices (routers/access points/repeaters). In noisy wireless environments, for better compatibility, and in low-signal distant connections it is best to use long preamble.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Mixed Mode; or short preamble with strong connections/no packet loss</p>

<h3>Afterburner</h3>
<p>A Broadcom-specific speed boost technology (125 High-Speed Mode) for older 802.11g adapters.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless using only compatible Broadcom devices.</p>

<p>Specifies the supported channel widths (20 MHz, 40 MHz, or both) for Wi-Fi operation.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Auto/20/40 MHz for best throughput unless compatibility issues arise.</p>

<h3>Beamforming</h3>
<p>A wireless technology that focuses Wi-Fi signals toward devices to improve range and throughput.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled, if both router and client support it.</p>

<h3>Bluetooth Collaboration</h3>
<p>Enhances coexistence between Wi-Fi and Bluetooth in the same device to reduce interference.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled if your device uses Bluetooth and Wi-Fi simultaneously.</p>

<h3>Channel Width</h3>
<p>Sets the frequency bandwidth (20 MHz or 40 MHz) for the wireless connection, impacting speed and compatibility.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Auto or 20/40 MHz; use 20 MHz if experiencing interference.</p>

<h3>D2 Listen Interval</h3>
<p>A power-saving feature that determines how often a device wakes up to receive data from the AP in certain power states.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default, 3 for performance, 7 for battery life</p>

<h3>Fat Channel Intolerant</h3>
<p>Forces 20 MHz channel use and signals intolerance to 40 MHz “fat” channels to the access point.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless nearby devices are having Wi-Fi issues.</p>

<h3>Fragmentation Threshold</h3>
<p>Specifies maximum packet size before data is fragmented; smaller values can reduce collisions in busy networks but may reduce throughput.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default; only adjust for troubleshooting.</p>

<h3>Global BG scan blocking</h3>
<p>Prevents background scans while connected to an access point for a more stable connection.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: On Good RSSI</p>

<h3>GTK rekeying for WoWLAN</h3>
<p>Enables Group Temporal Key (GTK) rekeying during Wake on Wireless LAN for security.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled to maintain secure connections during sleep.</p>

<h3>HT Mode</h3>
<p>Controls "High Throughput" 802.11n features (such as MIMO and wide channel support).</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled unless legacy device compatibility issues occur.</p>

<h3>Intel Throughput Enhancement</h3>
<p>An Intel-specific setting to optimize throughput for small packets over wireless networks.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled for improved throughput where supported.</p>

<h3>LTR Enable/Disable</h3>
<p>Latency Tolerance Reporting allows the Wi-Fi card and system platform to optimize for power saving during idle periods.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disable</p>

<h3>LTR Active Value</h3>
<p>Defines the LTR value, controlling how long the adapter can remain idle before entering low power mode.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disable</p>

<h3>MIMO Power Save Mode</h3>
<p>Optimizes MIMO (Multiple In Multiple Out) power consumption, trading off performance for battery savings.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: No SMPS</p>

<h3>Minimum Power Consumption</h3>
<p>Puts the adapter into its lowest possible power consumption mode at the cost of performance.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Mixed mode protection</h3>
<p>Adds extra signal protection for legacy devices on modern networks to prevent interference.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default should be fine, but CTS-to-self may provide more throughput where clients are closer</p>

<h3>NS Offload</h3>
<p>Offloads Neighbor Solicitation responses to the adapter for improved sleep performance.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Packet Coalescing</h3>
<p>Combines small packets together in low power states for efficient network communication.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>PLCP Header (BSS PLCP Header)</h3>
<p>Specifies the header format for communication between devices within a Basic Service Set.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default should be fine</p>

<h3>Power Output</h3>
<p>Controls the transmission power level of the Wi-Fi card, impacting range and battery use.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: 100% or highest, unless reducing interference is necessary.</p>

<h3>Preferred band</h3>
<p>Selects a preference for connecting to 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band when both are available.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: 5 GHz for less interference and potentially higher speeds; use Auto if unsure.</p>

<h3>Priority & VLAN</h3>
<p>Enables packet prioritization (QoS) and Virtual LAN tagging on Wi-Fi traffic.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless your network uses QoS or VLANs.</p>

<h3>Rate</h3>
<p>Manually sets the data rate for Wi-Fi transmission; most should leave it to auto-adjust dynamically.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Auto (default); only specify for particular legacy network requirements.</p>

<h3>Roaming Decision</h3>

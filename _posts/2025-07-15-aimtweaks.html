<p>In this article I cover 'Aim Tweaks' from Aphrodite, Risxn, Better Tweaks</p>

<h5>Post Update: Risxn changed the descriptions for his packs! Pretty much equally misleading but thought I should clear up the changes in my screenshots versus his current ones. One example below</h5>
<p>Before:</p>

<p>After:</p>

<h2>What Are Aim Tweaks Supposed to be?</h2>
<p>Creators such as Risxn claimed things such as reduced bloom, hitting harder shots, shooting through walls, and much more.</p>

<h3>Is it Legit?</h3>
<p>No, far from it actually. If we take a look at the code between all three different providers... Not only did they copy off of each other, but the optimizations do NOT affect aim in any regard. The script is a glorified TCP Optimizer batch file, paired with countless optimizations that also do NOT affect performance. There are some optimizations that affect performance, but nothing that would fulfill their promise on "tweaking aim"</p>
<p>I'll attach a few examples of the code within the files, but it's really sad to see that there's this level of misleading being sold for profit. I urge any and all sellers of "Aim Tweaks" to stop and take it down.</p>

<p><img src="/images/aimtweaks/tweaks/tps.png" alt="tweak"></p>
<p><img src="/images/aimtweaks/tweaks/wq.png" alt="tweak"></p>
<p>Once again, the scripts do include SOME legit optimizations(none shown in screenshots) that can help your game feel better and maybe more responsive; but its mostly common knowledge and tweaks that don't affect performance. They especially DO NOT affect aim, all claims stating they do are blatent lies.</p>

<p>Dislike videos promoting the usage and sale of Aim Tweaks</p>
<p>In servers promoting these, @ the owner and tell them to stop misleading their base.</p>

<h3>Important Reminder</h3>
<p>Don't send hate to anyone who distributes these sort of false tweaks; to effectively spread the knowledge and make a change, it must be done constructively. With a teaching mindset, not one of accusation and hate.</p>

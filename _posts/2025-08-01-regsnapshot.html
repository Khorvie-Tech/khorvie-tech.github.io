<p>Once the program is extracted and opened, you just want to run the executable and create a new snapshot. You don't have to close the program, but it's recommended to leave it open as you run through any changes to your machine that you're running via a file or tweaking program since the comparison will automatically be set to the current registry (will show all reg changes made from before running the program).</p>

<p>Once you through through all of your changes, just hit okay inside of Registry Changes View and it'll pop up a screen with all of the adjustments since the time of your created snapshot. Here are some example</p>

<p>This tool shows every change that happens within your system during the time frame, so you do need to sift through some of the random changes while looking for the direct changes made to your machine.</p>

<p>In this article, we'll be talking about the features and performance of Vtrl Lite, their free tier</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://youtu.be/rKE1dVHCrzQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video Version</a></p>
<p>Vtrl is an optimization utility project set up by a group of three developers, they've seen great success in their work with over 300k downloads. Let's take a look at their Lite version to see how much performance you can get from a fraction of the optimizations in their paid tier.</p>
<p>To give you a rough estimate of the differences between this version of lite and their premium, I interviewed the main developer 'mmunk' on the key differences</p>
<p>Free has:
  <ul>
    <li>24 total tweaks,</li>
    <li>powerplan optimizer,</li>
    <li>app booster,</li>
    <li>cleaner,</li>
    <li>debloat,</li>
    <li>startup optimizer,</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>Premium has:
  <ul>
    <li>(everything mentioned in free),</li>
    <li>83 total tweaks,</li>
    <li>focus mode,</li>
    <li>39 network tweaks,</li>
    <li>NIC optimizer,</li>
    <li>bufferbloat optimizer</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>But onto the reason why you are here...</p>

<h3>What features does Lite provide?</h3>
<p>
  <ul>
    <li>24 Optimizations</li>
    <li>Power Plan</li>
    <li>App Booster/QOS</li>
    <li>Cleaner</li>
    <li>Debloat</li>
    <li>Startup Accessibility</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<h3>Brief Rundown on Optimizations</h3>
<p><img src="/images/vtr/guide.png" alt="guide"></p>
<p>There are recommended tweaks which are considered safe for everyone on any system. Advanced tweaks which are good for you, but may be less safe if you dont know what you're doing; and then discretionary tweaks which can be chalked up to personal preference.</p>
<p>No advanced tweaks here in the free version, just recommended ones mostly. And there are some useful tips in here like disabling background apps and telemetry, along with background maintenance which is said to reduce background cpu usage. Better memory management settings along with plenty of other miscellaneous optimizations like disabling power saving states that are geared towards helping performance.</p>

<h3>My Thoughts</h3>
<p>Just from what I see, my only complaints with the program are that I no longer agree with... changing the mouse and keyboard data queue sizes, which if you want to know why not, <a href="https://khorvie.tech/mnkdataqueuesize/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this article will tell you</a>. I would also not recommend Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling to be an optimizaiton that gets turned off for everyone, I would add an 'advanced' flag to that instead of 'recommended'.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vtr/mnkqs.png" alt="mouse and keyboard data queue size"></p>
<p>Also as a personal user of Malwarebytes BG, their website is detected as a malware site. I believe it to be falsely flagged, so if they could work out with the vendor to stop getting false flagged, I know that would greatly improve reputation when other users of this extension when they visit their site.</p>

<h3>Performance</h3>
<p>We'll start off with system latency changes captured with the windows performance toolkit, captured 5 minutes post boot on each set of data.</p>
<p>We saw a 20% reduction in Average latency on the Nvidia driver; a 6.3% reduction on the DirectX Kernel. And lastly, an 86% reduction on the System Kernel</p>

<p>For our game of choice to benchmark, Fortnite. We actually ran into some problems with frames, it took multiple attempts before we got a benchmark that showed better results than the 'before' stat.</p>
<p><img src="/images/vtr/all.png" alt="fps"></p>
<p>I was able to point out the culprit and fix the performance by reenabling Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling, reverting this change allowed for consistent improvement in the frames.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I definitely don't believe it to be a bad product given that Lite is a newer product than their premium. I do however believe that they should tweak lite just a little bit more to add in some more worthwhile optimizations as the ones currently provided seem fairly basic in regards to FPS gain, I do have to give them props for the latency impact though.</p>
<p>To reiterate once again, my feedback to them is; remove the mouse and keyboard data queue sizes, change the tag on Hardware Accelerated GPU Scheduling from Recommended to Advanced, as it is not a tweak that should be disabled for everyone. And to also fix the false malware flagging issue from Malwarebytes on their website</p>

<h3>Note from the future: They talked about fixing my noted issues and many/if not all should be fixed in coming updates.</h3>

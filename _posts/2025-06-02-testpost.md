Win32PrioritySeparation is a Windows Registry value that controls how the system prioritizes CPU resources between foreground (active) applications and background services.
<!--more-->

This setting essentially affects how thread scheduling works, especially when the system is under load, by influencing quantum lengths and priority boosts. This can affect frames and responsiveness in video gaming scenarios.

# Casual Breakdown:

It's a registry setting in Windows that controls how your computer splits attention between:
The app you're using right now (foreground); and stuff running in the background (like updates, services)

### Why It Matters?

This setting tells Windows:
How long each app gets to use the CPU before switching
Whether your current app gets more love (runs faster/smoother)

### How to change it and recommended Values:

In your search bar type and open up the registry editor.
The value can be located at 
***HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\PriorityControl***
And should be a dword named ***Win32PrioritySeparation***

Through the testing of many optimizers within the community, *recommended values from nearly all good optimizers are* ***1a or 2a***
*(you insert these values as hexadecimal)*

#### Default Value
- for programs is 26hex/38dec
- for Background services is 18hex/24dec

### Khorvie Recommendation:
2a is generally more stable for system latency and frames but 1a has the potential on some systems to do this but much better. Try and test 2a for yourself for roughly 30 minutes then do the same with 1a, using capframex for benchmarks would be ideal but if you're unwilling then just go by feel.

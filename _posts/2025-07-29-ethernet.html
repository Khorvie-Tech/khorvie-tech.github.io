<p>Get recommended settings and information on common ethernet adapter nic settings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p> Note: There are a lot of caveats to what will be 'best' for you.... especially with network settings there is no true general consensus on what is best for everyone so make sure to apply settings carefully and test things for yourself</p>
<h3>Flow Control</h3>
<p>Allows the network adapter to manage traffic congestion by pausing data transmission when buffers are full, helping to prevent dropped packets during high traffic.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Jumbo Frames</h3>
<p>Increases the Ethernet frame size beyond the standard 1518 bytes, potentially improving throughput for large data transfers, but requires support from all network devices.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled (majority of the time for compatibility issues)</p>

<h3>Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE)</h3>
<p>Reduces power consumption during periods of low network activity by placing the network interface in a low power idle state.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Power Saving Mode</h3>
<p>Allows the adapter to enter a low-power state when the system is idle, saving energy but potentially delaying network connectivity on wake-up.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Auto Disable Gigabit</h3>
<p>Automatically disables Gigabit speeds when connecting to devices that do not support it to ensure compatibility or reduce power.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Wake on Magic Packet</h3>
<p>Allows the system to wake from a low-power state when a specially formatted network packet ("magic packet") is received.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless if you use Wake-On-LAN features</p>

<h3>Wake on pattern match</h3>
<p>Wakes the PC from a low-power state when network traffic matches specific patterns, such as ARP requests or network logins.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled, unless remote wake functionality is needed.</p>

<h3>Shutdown Wake-On-LAN</h3>
<p>Enables the network adapter to respond to Wake-On-LAN packets when the computer is fully shut down (S5 state).</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled for security; enable only if you need to power up machines remotely from shutdown.</p>

<h3>NS Offload</h3>
<p>Allows the NIC to respond to network neighbor discovery requests while the computer is in a low-power or sleep state.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled is generally fine if you don't actively utilize the feature, however with buggy implementation on the adapter, disabled may prove better.</p>

<h3>ARP Offload</h3>
<p>Lets the NIC answer ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) requests for the system’s IP while the computer is asleep, helping other devices maintain connectivity information.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled is generally fine, but if you wake your system and notice connectivity is bugged, try Disabled</p>

<h3>Receive/Transmit Buffers</h3>
<p>Controls the number of memory buffers for received and transmitted data for the network adapter.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: 1024 for both, or 1024 for Receive and 2048 for Transmit, or 2048 for both</p>

<h3>Large Send Offload / Large Receive Offload</h3>
<p>Allows the TCP stack to pass very large segments (up to 64KB) to the NIC, which then segments them into smaller packets matching the network’s MTU</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled (adapters usually aren't powerful enough for enabled or have compatibility issues when enabled)</p>

<h3>Offload TCP Segmentation</h3>
<p>Enables the network adapter to segment TCP data into packets, offloading the task from the CPU.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled (setting often has buggy implemenation when enabled)</p>

<h3>IPv4/TCP/UDP Checksum Offload</h3>
<p>Allows the network card to calculate and verify checksums in packet headers, reducing CPU burden.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled usually, but test both ways as there can be compatibility issues with it enabled</p>

<h3>Gigabit Lite</h3>
<p>A reduced-feature Gigabit mode that may increase compatibility with certain devices at the cost of full performance.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Receive/Transmit Descriptors</h3>
<p>Sets the number of descriptors for receive and transmit frames in the network adapter's buffer.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default; increase only if you experience network bottlenecks and have enough system RAM.</p>

<h3>Interrupt Moderation</h3>
<p>Allows the network adapter to group packets before interrupting the CPU, reducing overhead.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Enabled for general use; disable for low-latency (like gaming or real-time apps).</p>
<p>Side note: Disabling will cause more interrupts on the network driver which can give the appearance of higher latency</p>

<h3>Interrupt Moderation Rate</h3>
<p>Controls how often the network adapter interrupts the CPU to process packets, reducing CPU load at the cost of slightly increased latency.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default for most cases is fine</p>

<h3>Adaptive Inter-Frame Spacing</h3>
<p>Dynamically adjusts the spacing between frames sent to help with network congestion or performance issues.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Receive Side Scaling</h3>
<p>Enables simultaneous packet processing across multiple CPU cores to improve network throughput.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Test both ways (can cause performance issues when enabled)</p>

<h3>Log Link State Event</h3>
<p>Records link state changes (e.g., link up/down) in the system log for diagnostic purposes.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: (optional) Disabled unless needed</p>

<h3>Gigabit Master Slave Mode</h3>
<p>Sets whether the network adapter operates as a master or slave during Ethernet negotiation.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Auto (default); specify Master or Slave only to resolve network connectivity issues.</p>

<h3>MAC Address / Locally Administered Address</h3>
<p>Allows you to manually set a custom MAC address for the network interface.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Leave blank (default) unless a custom MAC is required.</p>

<h3>Speed and Duplex</h3>
<p>Sets the speed and duplex mode (half/full) of the adapter.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Auto-Negotiation; only force a specific value for compatibility or when not receiving your full link speeds.</p>

<h3>Green Ethernet (Short Reach Mode)</h3>
<p>Reduces power use if the cable is short and full Gigabit speeds are not required.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Wake-On-LAN and Shutdown Link speed</h3>
<p>Determines the link speed the adapter uses in low-power/Wake-on-LAN modes.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Auto/Default; adjust only if Wake-on-LAN does not function as expected.</p>

<h3>DMA Coalescing</h3>
<p>Lowers power consumption by aggregating multiple DMA (Direct Memory Access) operations into fewer events during low traffic.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled, or Enabled to save power.</p>

<h3>Enable PME</h3>
<p>Enables Power Management Events (PME) to allow the device to wake the computer from sleep on network activity.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless you need Wake-on-LAN or remote wake functions; otherwise .</p>

<h3>Gigabit Phy Mode</h3>
<p>Option to configure PHY (Physical Layer) settings for Gigabit Ethernet for certain compatibility situations.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Default/Auto; modify only to resolve compatibility issues.</p>

<h3>Priority Packet & VLAN</h3>
<p>Enables support for IEEE 802.1p QoS tagging and VLANs, letting traffic be prioritized or separated.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless network environment supports and uses VLAN/QoS features.</p>

<h3>PTP Hardware timestamp</h3>
<p>Adds timestamping to packets for IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol synchronization over Ethernet.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless using PTP synchronization (rare outside enterprise or specialized setups).</p>

<h3>Reduce Speed on Power Down</h3>
<p>Lowers the connection speed when the system enters a low-power state to save energy.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Software Timestamp</h3>
<p>Adds timestamping to packets for synchronization at the software level.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless specifically required for diagnostics or time-sensitive applications.</p>

<h3>Wait for link</h3>
<p>Determines whether the system waits for a network link before finishing startup processes.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled</p>

<h3>Wake on Link settings</h3>
<p>Wakes the system when a network link becomes active, not just by wake-on-LAN packets.</p>
<p>Recommended setting: Disabled unless needed for your remote wake scenario.</p>

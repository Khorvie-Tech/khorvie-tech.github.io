<h5>Is it safe/should I use this?</h5>
<p>Is it Safe? Generally speaking, yes. This tool is regarded as very safe, now that doesn't mean run through and apply or install everything you see, but it is a useful application to have in your arsenal. Visit the source code <a href="https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/winutil" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>: </p>
<p>Should you use it? I wouldn't say it is a necessity on already optimized systems, but it does provide lots of easy access to other program installations along with some sound tweaks to apply if you're on a fresh installation of windows.</p>
